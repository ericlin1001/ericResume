# Adaptive Parallel Differential Evolution for PEC, Mar. 2015 -- Jul. 2016
*C++, MPI,* Maintainer Individual Academic Project
A parallel program running in cluster to solve Power Electronic Circuit(PEC) problem, https://github.com/ericlin1001/AdaptivePDE

- Parallelized Differential Evolution(DE) algorithm, the speedup was nearly half of the number of CPU cores
- Support for adaptively distributing tasks among cores, efficiently utilizing all CPU cores
- Defined an unified Json format for setting up all DE's arguments
- Published corresponding paper: Parallel Differential Evolution Based on Distributed Cloud Computing Resources for Power Electronic Circuit Optimization in GECCO '16 Companion


# Help-Each-Other, Jul. 2013 -- Dec. 2013
*Php, Project Manager,* Team Project, collaborated with three classmates
A web application providing a way to facilitate people help each other, https://github.com/ericlin1001/HelpEachOtherProject

- Implemented task management system, allowed users to pose and accept tasks
- Support user ranking based on the number of tasks the user finished 
- Implemented online chat system, feedback system


# Eric-OS, Jan. 2013 -- Jun. 2013
*Asm, C,* Maintainer Term Project, Individual Project
A basic Operating System(OS), https://github.com/ericlin1001/EricOSProject

- Implemented Buddy based Memory Management, support dynamic memory allocating
- Support reading files in FAT12 Filesystem
- Implemented Process Scheduling, Inter-process Communication, and standard input output(IO)
- Used as an standard example by the teacher, and I was invited to explain it to the whole class
